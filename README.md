## Hi there 👋

👋 Welcome to my GitHub

Hello, I’m Bin Lei, a Backend Engineer with 5+ years of experience specializing in Java-based backend systems, distributed services, and production-grade infrastructure.

I have hands-on experience in IoT platforms, financial systems, and high-concurrency backend services, with a strong focus on system stability, scalability, and business reliability — qualities highly valued in Singapore engineering teams.

💼 Professional Philosophy (Singapore-Oriented)

🧩 Business-Driven Engineering

I design backend systems with a business-first mindset, ensuring that technical decisions support scalability, operational efficiency, and long-term maintainability.

I am experienced in systems that:

- directly support revenue-related features
- handle real-time data streams
- operate under high concurrency and strict reliability requirements

⚙️ Reliability & Production Readiness

I value production stability over technical novelty.

My daily engineering focus includes:

- fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- logging, monitoring, and incident troubleshooting
- backward compatibility and safe deployments

🤝 Collaboration & Ownership

I work closely with:

- product managers to clarify requirements
- frontend engineers to align API contracts
- DevOps and operations teams during deployment and production support

I take ownership of the systems I build and maintain.
