## Hi there 👋

👋 Welcome to my GitHub

Hello, I’m Bin Lei, a Backend Engineer with 5+ years of experience specializing in Java-based backend systems, distributed services, and production-grade infrastructure.

I have hands-on experience in IoT platforms, financial systems, and high-concurrency backend services, with a strong focus on system stability, scalability, and business reliability — qualities highly valued in Singapore engineering teams.

💼 Professional Philosophy (Singapore-Oriented)

🧩 Business-Driven Engineering

I design backend systems with a business-first mindset, ensuring that technical decisions support scalability, operational efficiency, and long-term maintainability.

I am experienced in systems that:

- directly support revenue-related features
- handle real-time data streams
- operate under high concurrency and strict reliability requirements

⚙️ Reliability & Production Readiness

I value production stability over technical novelty.

My daily engineering focus includes:

- fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- logging, monitoring, and incident troubleshooting
- backward compatibility and safe deployments

🤝 Collaboration & Ownership

I work closely with:

- product managers to clarify requirements
- frontend engineers to align API contracts
- DevOps and operations teams during deployment and production support

I take ownership of the systems I build and maintain.

📦 Professional Experience

✅ Backend Engineer — Smart Energy IoT Platform (2023 – Present)  

- Designed and implemented backend services to collect, parse, and process IoT data from inverters, batteries, meters, and energy storage devices.  
- Built Netty-based communication services using MQTT/TCP to send commands and receive real-time device data.  
- Implemented energy production, consumption, and revenue calculation logic based on peak / off-peak electricity pricing.  
- Developed device management features including remote diagnostics, command dispatching, and firmware upgrade workflows.  
- Used Kafka to distribute processed data to downstream business modules in real time.  

Impact: Enabled real-time monitoring and visualization of energy generation and storage performance. Improved data reliability and consistency across multiple energy-related subsystems.
